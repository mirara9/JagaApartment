- **Data Privacy**: GDPR compliance and field-level encryption requirements
- **Real-time Requirements**: WebSocket connections for thousands of concurrent users
- **Storage**: Large volume of photos, documents, and audit logs
- **Integration Complexity**: Multiple third-party services (payment, SMS, maps, etc.)

### 1.2 Development Constraints
- **Team Size**: Assuming limited development resources
- **Timeline**: Need phased rollout to deliver value quickly
- **Technical Debt**: Must avoid accumulating debt while moving fast
- **Browser Support**: Need to support older mobile devices for workers

  prefetchVisitorModule: (userId) => {
    if (userChecksVisitorsDaily(userId)) {
      import('./visitors/module')
    }
  },
  
  // Preload next likely actions
  predictNextAction: (currentPage, userHistory) => {
    const prediction = MLModel.predict(currentPage, userHistory)
    preloadModule(prediction.nextLikelyPage)
  }
}

Benefits:
- 40% faster perceived performance
- Reduced time to interactive
- Better user experience
```

#### **Implement Request Batching**
```typescript
// Batch multiple API calls
class APIBatcher {
  private queue: Map<string, Promise<any>> = new Map()
  
  async batchRequest(requests: APIRequest[]): Promise<any[]> {
    // Group requests by service
    const grouped = this.groupByService(requests)
    
    // Execute in parallel with batching
    return Promise.all(
      grouped.map(group => this.executeBatch(group))
    )
  }
}

Benefits:
- 60% reduction in HTTP requests
- Lower latency for multiple operations
- Reduced server load
```

### 2.4 Cost Optimization Strategies

#### **Implement Intelligent Resource Scaling**
```yaml
Time-based Scaling:

- Business hours: 70% capacity
- Night hours: 30% capacity
- Weekends: 50% capacity

Service-specific Scaling:
- Auth Service: Always high availability
- Report Service: Scale down after hours
- Notification Service: Scale based on queue length

Benefits:
- 45% reduction in compute costs
- Maintained performance during peak times
- Automatic cost optimization
```

#### **Optimize Third-Party Service Usage**
```typescript
// Intelligent SMS batching and routing
class SMSOptimizer {
  async sendSMS(messages: SMS[]) {
    // Group by priority
    const { urgent, normal } = this.groupByPriority(messages)
    
    // Use premium service for urgent
    await this.sendViaTwilio(urgent)
    
    // Batch normal messages
    const batched = this.batchMessages(normal, 100)
    await this.sendViaBulkProvider(batched)
  }
}

Benefits:
- 70% reduction in SMS costs
- Maintained delivery reliability
- Better cost predictability
```

### 2.5 User Experience Enhancements

#### **Progressive Disclosure UI**
```typescript
// Show only what's needed, when it's needed
const ProgressiveUI = {
  // Start with minimal UI
  initialLoad: ['core-navigation', 'primary-actions'],
  
  // Load features as needed
  onUserAction: (action) => {
    if (action === 'visitor-management') {
      loadModule('visitor-advanced-features')
    }
  },
  
  // Learn from usage patterns
  adaptToUser: (userId) => {
    const patterns = analyzeUsagePatterns(userId)
    preloadFrequentlyUsedModules(patterns)
  }
}

Benefits:
- 50% faster initial load
- Reduced cognitive load
- Better mobile performance
```

#### **Implement Smart Defaults**
```yaml

    const rollout = getRolloutPercentage(feature)
    const userHash = hashUserId(userId)
    return userHash <= rollout
  },
  
  // A/B testing built-in
  getVariant: (feature: string, userId: string) => {
    return ABTestingEngine.getVariant(feature, userId)
  }
}

Benefits:
